# dotfiles

some of my configuration files for various programs
using the GNU Stow package

the file tree is arranged by application and then where it's located in my target directory
aka $HOME directory, so stow directory is app/.confg/app for output directory ~/.config/app to show up correctly

mainly used to restore my systems or update them

feel free to use whatever
